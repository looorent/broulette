I’d never tried a Karmeliet Tripel before so I ordered a pint and my wife ordered an Oasis to go with our meals. I had the meatballs with pasta instead of chips, and she had the lamb chops with chips and salad. The meatballs were so soft and the sauce was very rich in flavour with the acidity of the tomatoes not being overwhelming at all. The lamb chops fell off the bone, were very tender, and didn’t at all have the taste of game which was a pleasant surprise.
